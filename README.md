"So.. passwords are very important.. but you already knew that.. But, honestly you don't worry about it, because you haven't been comprimsed" (*Knock on wood*)


It goes with out saying that Passwords are used for protecting users sensitive information; like bank accounts, PS4/XBOX accounts, Netflix, Amazon etc.  But, unfortunately users can be still be compromised. Below is a screen shot of an article that has some data that raise a lot of red flads!! :triangular_flag_on_post: :triangular_flag_on_post: :triangular_flag_on_post:

![password stats data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HEEM86/PasswordGeneratorEW/master/Assets/Images/password%20stats%20image.png)

The stats that stand out to me is that 57% of people don't change their passwords after being comprised and 23 million account holders are still using the password "123456". :dizzy_face:


How do we better protect ourselves..? We protect ourselves by using better passwords. I've create a password generator application to give you an example of what a strong password should be, in addtion I will provide some context of the application, along with some tips on password protection.

This password generator is a great example of the type of passwords that will give users a high level of protection. Although this is a great tool to use, here are some best practices for password protection to help maintain the security of your information. 

1. If you don't use a keyword generator create a unique password that's has nothing obvious; like your name or birthday.

2. Try to mix up your passwords with different accounts

3. Try to rotate new passwords for senitive accounts like: Bank Accounts, Social Media, Billing Accounts etc.

4. If you've been comprised change your password

5. Use apps on your phone to remeber your passwords. Avoid writing down passwords on paper or post its. 


## Conclusion :bulb:

The purpose of this assignment was really just to create a password generation application and to make sure it is functioning appropriately. I wanted to provide some further insight, because unfortunately I was a victum of identity theft. Thankfully it wasn't to serious. I just wanted to shine some on the important of password protection. 

## Challenges :loudspeaker:

I had an issue with the "VAR", because I had already defined variables being changed, hopefully I'm making sense.. My tutor suggest the "LET" commands that made things alot more simple and cut the amount of code down significantlly. I have a few refences below that help me further understand "LET" and why it's a better option than "VAR"
